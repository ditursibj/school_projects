                                	<p>The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus <em>Panthera</em>. Some subspecies of lions include the North African lion, the Asiatic lion, the West African lion, the Cape lion and the East African lion. Lions typically inhabit grasslands and savannahs, such as those in Africa and Asia. However, you will not see any lions in forests or colder climates, such as a tundra. Majority of male lions grow to be about 500 pounds, which is the second largest living cat species after tigers. Typically, lions in the wild will rarely live longer than 10 to 14 years, as injuries from battling rival males eventualy take their toll. In contrast, lions kept in captivity can live well beyond 20 years.</p>
									<p>Lions spend most of their day resting, and can be inactive for lengths up to 20 hours. Lions are generally most active from dusk to dawn, when it is prime feeding time. In regards to socializing, lions are among on of the most social animals. You will rarely ever find a lion or lioness traveling alone. Lions live in what is called a pride, which is a group of lions closely related to one another with their offspring.</p>

                                	<p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.</p>
									<p>The largest living species is the emperor penguin (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>) on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.</p>

                                	<p>An alligator is a crocodilian in the genus <em>Alligator</em> of the family Alligatoridae. The two living species are the American alligator (<em>A. mississippiensis</em>) and the Chinese alligator (<em>A. sinensis</em>). In addition, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the Paleocene epoch about 66 million years ago.</p>
									<p>American alligators are found in the southeast United States: all of Florida and Louisiana; the southern parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi; coastal South and North Carolina; East Texas, the southeast corner of Oklahoma, and the southern tip of Arkansas. According to the 2005 Scholastic Book of World Records, Louisiana has the largest alligator population. The majority of American alligators inhabit Florida and Louisiana, with over a million alligators in each state. Southern Florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles live side by side.American alligators live in freshwater environments, such as ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and swamps, as well as in brackish environments. When they construct alligator holes in the wetlands, they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animals during droughts. They are, therefore, considered an important species for maintaining ecological diversity in wetlands. Farther west, in Louisiana, heavy grazing by coypu and muskrat are causing severe damage to coastal wetlands. Large alligators feed extensively on coypu, and provide a vital ecological service by reducing coypu numbers.</p>

                              		<p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>), the African forest elephant (<em>L. cyclotis</em>), and the Asian elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.</p>
									<p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
									<p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as lions, tigers, hyenas, and any wild dogs, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the matriarch, often the oldest cow.</p>

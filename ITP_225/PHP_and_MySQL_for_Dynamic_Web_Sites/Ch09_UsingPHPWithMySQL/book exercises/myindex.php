	<p>This is my main page. Click on the links in the navigation bar above to see some of my work or links about the PHP programming language.</p>
	
	<p>Learning PHP, like any programming language can best be summed up by these three quotes:</p>
	
	<p>"The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwile are, first, hard work, second, stick-to-itiveness; third, common sense." Thomas Edison</p>
	
	<p>"There are no shortcuts to any place worth going." Beverly Sills</p>

	<p>"Don't wish it were easier. Wish you were better." Jim Rohn</p>
	
	<p>"I was a Computer Science major. I got out once it got really hard. I made it up to C++. Then I couldn't do the math - it got really confusing. I switched to Communications, which is a ridiculous major - let's be honest." Jimmy Fallon</p>
